# What is OPC?  
OPC is the interoperability standard for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial  
automation space and in other industries. It is platform independent and ensures the seamless flow   
of information among devices from multiple vendors. The OPC Foundation is responsible for the   
development and maintenance of this standard.  

The OPC standard is a series of specifications developed by industry vendors, end-users and software   
developers. These specifications define the interface between Clients and Servers, as well as Servers   
and Servers, including access to real-time data, monitoring of alarms and events, access to historical   
data and other applications.
