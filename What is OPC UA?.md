# What is OPC?  
OPC is the interoperability standard for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial  
automation space and in other industries. It is platform independent and ensures the seamless flow   
of information among devices from multiple vendors. The OPC Foundation is responsible for the   
development and maintenance of this standard.  

The OPC standard is a series of specifications developed by industry vendors, end-users and software   
developers. These specifications define the interface between Clients and Servers, as well as Servers   
and Servers, including access to real-time data, monitoring of alarms and events, access to historical   
data and other applications.

# OPC UA  
The [OPC Unified Architecture](https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/), is a platform independent service-oriented architecture that integrates all the functionality of the individual OPC Classic specifications into one extensible framework.  
Building on the success of OPC Classic, OPC UA was designed to enhance and surpass the capabilities of the OPC Classic specifications. OPC UA is functionally equivalent to OPC Classic, yet capable of much more:  
1.**Discovery**: find the availability of OPC Servers on local PCs and/or networks . 
2.**Address space**: all data is represented hierarchically (e.g. files and folders) allowing for simple and complex  structures to be discovered and utilized by OPC Clients . 
3.**On-demand**: read and write data/information based on access-permissions . 
4.**Subscriptions**: monitor data/information and report-by-exception when values change based on a client’s criteria . 
5.**Events**: notify important information based on client’s criteria . 
6.**Methods**: clients can execute programs, etc. based on methods defined on the server .
