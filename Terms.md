**WAR file**  
[from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)):  
In software engineering, a WAR file (Web Application Resource or Web application ARchive) is a   
file used to distribute a collection of JAR-files, JavaServer Pages, Java Servlets, Java classes,  
XML files, tag libraries, static web pages (HTML and related files) and other resources that together   
constitute a web application.  
The /WEB-INF/classes directory is on the ClassLoader's classpath. (The classpath consists of a list of  
locations from which .class files can be loaded and executed by the JVM.) The /WEB-INF/classes directory  
contains the classes associated with the web application itself.

Any JAR files placed in the /WEB-INF/lib directory will also be placed on the ClassLoader's classpath.
